7. Create directory structure : Give following commands ,
-> mkdir one
-> cd one
-> touch 1.txt 11.txt 111.txt
-> mkdir two
-> cd two
-> touch 2.txt 22.txt 222.txt
-> mkdir three
-> cd three
-> touch 3.txt 33.txt 333.txt
-> mkdir four
-> cd four
-> touch 4.txt 44.txt 444.txt
-> mkdir five
-> cd five
-> touch 5.txt 55.txt 555.txt
-> cd ~ (i.e. go to your home directory)



8. Considering above directory structure , Do following
operations :


i. list the directory contents of directory named
"five" from current directory (i.e. home directory).
ls ~/study/OS_CLASSWORK/One/two/three/four/five
555.txt  55.txt  5.txt




ii. write your name in a file named "44.txt" of
directory "four" from current directory.

cat > ~/study/OS_CLASSWORK/One/two/three/four/44.txt
Satyajeet

cat  ~/study/OS_CLASSWORK/One/two/three/four/44.txt
Satyajeet


iii. remove the file named "555.txt" from directory
"five" from current directory.


rm ~/study/OS_CLASSWORK/One/two/three/four/five/555.txt


iv. change directory to five
one/two/three/four/five/ ).
( i.e. cd


cd  ~/study/OS_CLASSWORK/One/two/three/four/five

v. write your course name in file named "3.txt" which
resides in directory "three" from current directory (i.e.
five).also read the same file.

cat > ../../3.txt
PG-DAC

satyajeet@Predator:~/study/OS_CLASSWORK/One/two/three/four/five$ cat ../../3.txt
PG-DAC



vi. list the contents of directory "two" from current
directory (i.e. five).

ls ../../../
222.txt  22.txt  2.txt  three

vii. remove file named "222.txt" which belongs to
directory "two" from current directory (i.e. five)

rm ../../../222.txt


viii. now change the directory to "one"

 cd ../../../..
 
ix. remove all files only from directory named "five"
from current directory (i.e. one)

 rm ./two/three/four/Five/*

 
x. remove directory named "five" from current directory
(i.e. one)

 rmdir ./two/three/four/Five


xi. remove whole directory named "four" from current
directory (i.e. one)
rm -R ./two/three/four


xii. change to your home directory.

cd ~


9. change the time stamp of file named "3.txt" which resides
